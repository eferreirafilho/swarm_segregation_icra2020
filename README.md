# Segregation of Heterogeneous Swarms of Robots in Curves
IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2020), held fully virtually, from 31 May to 31 August.
Authors: Edson B. F. Filho and Luciano C. A. Pimenta

This paper proposes a decentralized control strategy to reach segregation in heterogeneous robot swarms distributed in curves. The approach is based on a formation control algorithm applied to each robot and a heuristics to compute the distance between the groups, i.e. the distance from the beginning of the curve. We consider that robots can communicate through a fixed underlying topology and also when they are within a certain distance. A convergence proof with a collision avoidance strategy is presented. Simulations and experimental results show that our approach allows a swarm of multiple heterogeneous robots to segregate into groups.
